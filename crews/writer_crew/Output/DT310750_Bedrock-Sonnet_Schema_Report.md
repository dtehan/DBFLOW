## Table Name: ibm_stock

The IBM_STOCK table appears to capture historical stock price data for IBM. This table likely serves as a record of IBM's stock performance over time, which can be useful for financial analysis, trend tracking, and historical reference. The data stored in this table could be used by investors, analysts, or internal IBM teams to study stock price movements and make informed decisions.

Here's a breakdown of the attributes:

• id: A unique identifier for each stock price entry. This helps in distinguishing between different records and maintaining data integrity.

• name: The name of the company, which in this case is always "ibm". This column might be useful if the table were to expand to include other companies' stock data in the future.

• period: The date of the stock price record. This allows for tracking of price changes over time and enables time-based analysis.

• stockprice: The actual stock price on the given date. This is the core data point, representing the market value of IBM stock at that specific time.


## Table Name: mydata

The mydata table appears to be designed for storing time-series data, likely for tracking a specific metric or measurement over time. This table could be used for various purposes such as monitoring system performance, tracking daily sales figures, or recording sensor readings at regular intervals.

Here's a breakdown of the attributes:

• timestamp: This is a VARCHAR field that stores the date and time of each data point. Although it's stored as a string, the format suggests it's being used to represent dates in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.

• value: This is a BIGINT field that stores the actual numerical data associated with each timestamp. The use of BIGINT suggests that the values could be quite large or that precision is important for this measurement.

Both fields are marked as NOT NULL, ensuring that every row has both a timestamp and a corresponding value, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity in time-series analysis.


## Table Name: student

The student table captures information about students, their enrolled courses, and their academic performance. This table is likely used in an educational institution's database system to track student records, course enrollments, and grades.

Here's a breakdown of the attributes:

• Student_ID: A unique identifier for each student, used as the primary key for the table.
• Name: The full name of the student, stored as a varchar to accommodate various name lengths and characters.
• Course_ID: An identifier for the course in which the student is enrolled, likely linking to a separate course table.
• Marks: The numerical score or grade the student received for the course, representing their academic performance.

This table structure allows for easy querying of student performance, course enrollment statistics, and individual student records. It can be used for generating report cards, analyzing course popularity, and tracking student progress over time.
